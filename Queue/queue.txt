like a stack, queue is a linear data structure that stores items in a first in first out manner.

with a queue, the recently addeditem is removed first

Operations associated with queue:
    Enqueue: adds an item to the queue. if the queue is full, then it is said to be an overflow condition.

    Dequeue:
    removes an item from the queue. the items are popped in the same order they were pushed.
    if the queue is empty, the its an underflow condition

    Front:
    get the front item from the queue, time complexity O(1)

    Rear:
    get the last item from queue, time complexity O(1)
