involves a functin calling itself directly or indirectly to solve a problem by breaking it down into simpler and mor managable parts.

Basic Structure of Recursive Function
def recursive_function(parameters):


    if base_case_condition:


        return base_result


    else:


        return recursive_function(modified_parameters)

BASE CASE:
This is the condition under which te recursion stops.

RECURSIVE CASE:
This is the part of the function that includesthe call to itself
